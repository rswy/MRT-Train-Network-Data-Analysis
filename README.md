## SMRT Train Network Analysis

## Questions: 
* Q1: What is the underlying MRT network according to the dataset provided? You should derive the network using only the dataset provided, without referring to other resources, such as the MRT network in Singapore from SMRT, Wiki, Datamall, etc.
* Q2: Given an origin and destination station pair (say Station A and Station B), how many trains travelled from Station A to Station B in the given dataset?
* Q3: Suppose a commuter wants to board a train at Clementi Station at 9:25am and alight at Kallang Station. Can you determine the number of people in the train at every station along the path from Clementi to Kallang starting from 9:25am?Â¶
